# why does it say its malware? (windows defender + virustotal)
first of all virus total is shit so is windows defender, and most av will think its a virus, anyways here
https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/2701 , i use nuitka to compile which has a history of windows defender saying its malware + the virus total reports being high (please read everything in the issue)

# triage
triage doesn't exactly say its "malware" its a 2/27 which is sus, usually triage would tell you what type it is, if its a rat or grabber and it shows you what the file tries to do.
